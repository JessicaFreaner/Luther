# Luther - Exploring Movie Data

Second project within the Metis Bootcamp. Asked to analyze movie data (from [Box Office Mojo](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/ "Box Office Mojo")), I choose to explore relationship between Seasonality / Genre / MPAA Rating interactions and Budget in determining Box Office success (i.e., Domestic Movie Gross). 

Data was scraped from over 4,000 movies in Wide Release since 1982. Budget was adjusted for inflation with data obtained from [Wolfram Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/ "Wolfram Alpha") Inflation Adjuster.

iPython Notebook file is the initial cleaning and analysis of the dataset.

PDF is the [final presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/JessFreaner/luther-presentation-47482095 "Slideshare") of findings and proposed actions.
