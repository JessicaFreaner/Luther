{"name":"Luther","tagline":"Exploring Movie Data","body":"# Luther - Exploring Movie Data\r\n\r\nSecond project within the Metis Bootcamp. Asked to analyze movie data (from Box Office Mojo), I choose to explore relationship between Seasonality / Genre / MPAA Rating interactions and Budget in determining Box Office success (i.e., Domestic Movie Gross). \r\n\r\nData was scraped from over 4,000 movies in Wide Release since 1982. Budget was adjusted for inflation with data obtained from Wolfram Alpha Inflation Adjuster.\r\n\r\nIpython Notebook file is the initial cleaning and analysis of the dataset.\r\n\r\nPDF is the final presentation of findings and proposed actions.\r\n\r\n##Other Metis Projects:\r\n[Benson](http://jessicafreaner.github.io/Benson/ \"Exploring MTA Data\")\r\n[McNulty](http://jessicafreaner.github.io/McNulty/ \"Exploring Heart Health Data\")\r\n[Fletcher](http://jessicafreaner.github.io/Fletcher/ \"Exploring Data with NLP\")\r\n[Kojak](http://jessicafreaner.github.io/Kojak/ \"Exploring NYC's Moving Populations\")\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
